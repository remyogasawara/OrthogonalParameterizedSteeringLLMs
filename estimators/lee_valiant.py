  """
  Implements the original Lee-Valiant algorithm for robust mean estimation.

  This function first takes a random gamma percentage sample of the data and computes a 
  preliminary mean using a given mean estimator. It calculates an average of the coordinate-wise
  differences of points from this preliminary mean estimate, weighting points included in the original
  mean estimate and the t percentage of points with the largest distance from the sample mean by 0. 
  The final mean is calculated as a sum of the original mean estimate with this average.

  Parameters:
  data (np.ndarray): A 2D array where rows represent samples and columns represent features.
  mean_estimator (function): A function to estimate the mean of the given data.
  gamma (float): The fraction of the data to be used for the preliminary mean estimate. 
  t (float): The fraction of the data to be pruned based on the distance from the preliminary mean.
  
  Note on parameters:
  Instead of using the astronomically large parameters described in the paper, which preclude
  a practical implementation, we set gamma as 0.5 and t as expected corruption.
